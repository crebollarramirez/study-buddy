## How It Works
Teachers use the Teacher Interface to prompt the ChatBot and grant access to students. Students then engage with the ChatBot via the Student Interface, explaining topics and receiving immediate, deep questions that encourage critical thinking. This interaction is designed to simulate a one-on-one session with a mentor, utilizing the principles of Socratic teaching.
